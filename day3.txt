Region
------->

regions are geographic locations where Microsoft Azure operates data centers.

Availability zones
------------------->

Availability zones are physical locations within a region that are designed to be highly resilient to power outages, network failures, and natural disasters. 

Each availability zone is made up of one or more data centers that have independent power, cooling, and networking.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
----------------------------->
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is a service that allows you to manage and deploy resources in Azure.
. Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is a free Azure service that allows you to deploy, manage, and monitor Azure resources.
. It provides a management layer that lets you create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account.
. If you interact with any resource on Azure, it goes through the ARM. whether you use the portal, Powershell, Azure CLI.

Identity and Access Management
________________________________>
Identity and access management (IAM) in Azure is a role-based access control system that allows IT to control user access to critical information. 


Azure Active Directory: (WHO)

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service from Microsoft.

Azure Active Directory contains the identities that we use to authenticate and prove who we are is who we say we are, that we will then use to assign various roles and permissions.

Azure Role Based Access Control: (CAN DO WHAT)

With Azure Role-Based Access Control, we are able to provide different types or different levels of access to different resources in our Azure environment.


Scope :

scope determines "on which resources" our identities have different levels of access to.





Azure Monitor
-------------->

Azure Monitor is a tool that collects and analyzes data about Azure resources and the infrastructure they run on.

Azure Monitor collects data from various sources, including:
. Logs and metrics from the Azure platform and resources
. Custom applications
. Agents running on virtual machines



Logs:

/ text based recoed of events

. Activity logs : "who created the resource and when"
. OS logs : "why is windows is giving an error"

Metrics:

/ numerical based(may be graphs, charts...)
it is a measure of performance of our different resources

. CPU utilization
. website traffic





VIRTUAL MACHINE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>

. A virtual machine (VM) is a digital version of a physical computer.
Advantages:
. availability sets (Availability sets in Azure are logical groupings of virtual machines (VMs).They allow Azure to understand how an application is built to provide redundancy and availability.)
 = VM replication
 = Replicate VM for better fault tolerance
 = If a VM goes down, a copied VM can take over
. scale sets  (Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) are a way to create and manage a group of identical virtual machines (VMs).)
 = A scale set is often paired with a load balancer in which you can have multiple copies of virtual machines, which enables you to scale up or down your application based on user demand.

 = scaling copies of application
 = enables scaling, and elasticty

In Azure, an availability set is a collection of availability zones, while a scale set is a collection of instance sizes. 
 
Availability set
A collection of discrete VMs that provide hardware protection in the data center that hosts your VM. Availability sets are used to enhance application availability.

Scale set
A collection of identically configured VMs that provide an increase in resources for your workload. Scale sets automatically increase or decrease the number of VM instances in response to demand or a defined schedule.

Differences 
VMs
Availability sets do not require VMs to be identical. Scale sets have identical VMs.
Usage
Availability sets are used to enhance application availability. Scale sets are used to configure the number of instances that a given application can run on.


VIRTUAL NETWORK (Vnet)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>

A VNet allows Azure resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), to securely communicate with each other.

Provides private and public network communication among azure resources.

A virtual network (VNet) is a container that allows communication between resources and services within the Azure cloud environment. A server is a specialized computer or software system that provides services, data, or resources to other computers over a network.

STORAGE ACCOUNTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>
An Azure storage account is a container that groups all of your Azure Storage data services together. 
storage accounts contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, and tables

. blob(object)
. files
. Disks
. Queues
. Tables

Blob (Binary Large Object)
- Blob stands for Binary Large Object. Azure Blob allows users to store large amounts of unstructured data. Blobs are collections of data that can include files, images, audio, video, and other types of unstructured data.

Files

- File Storage is designed for storing structured data in the form of files and directories.
- Azure File Storage simplifies file sharing and data storage in the cloud, making it easy to migrate and manage data across your cloud infrastructure.

Disks

-Azure Disk Storage is a cloud storage solution from Microsoft Azure. It provides high-performance, durable, and scalable storage for workloads such as virtual machines, databases, and business-critical applications. 

Queue

- Azure Queue Storage is a service that stores large numbers of messages. Messages can be up to 64 KB in size and can be accessed from anywhere in the world using HTTP or HTTPS

Tables

- NoSQL database storage
- Gradually trasitioning to Cosmos DB


DATABASE
~~~~~~~~~~>
"database" refers to a cloud-based data storage and management service that allows you to store, organize, and retrieve data

ANALYTICS
~~~~~~~~~~>

"analytics" refers to the process of collecting, processing, and gaining insights from data using various services and tools provided by Microsoft's cloud platform. 



APP SERVICE
~~~~~~~~~~~~>

Azure App Service is a cloud service that allows developers to build and deploy mobile and web apps. It's a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering, which means that Azure manages everything except the business application and its data. This means that developers don't have to worry about managing the network or infrastructure.
